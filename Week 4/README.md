This week proved to be challenging working in 3D space. Trying to create an array of 3d boxes wasn't going so well, so Taylor Miller and I got into a call and brainstormed about it. He didn't know much about the 3d workings of p5js, but we eventually got to a place where we understood each other about my problems. After a couple hours of working together we declared an array, but didn't put it in the setup, because all the examples we looked at didn't have it, so we came to the conclusion that it was unneeded in the setup. I was hoping that maybe we could talk a bit more about it next class.
